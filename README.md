Car Price Prediction - EDA Project
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a car price prediction dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The dataset contains information about various car features, and the goal is to explore the relationships between these features and predict the price of the car.

The EDA includes steps such as:

Data cleaning: Identifying missing values, handling categorical features, and encoding them.

Statistical analysis: Summarizing the data using statistical measures.

Visualization: Visualizing the distribution of car prices, relationships between car features, and identifying any trends or anomalies.

Dataset
The dataset is available as a CSV file: car_price_prediction.csv. It contains several columns with information about cars, including but not limited to:

Price: The price of the car.

Year: The year the car was manufactured (or the model year).

Make: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Tesla, BMW, etc.).

Other features: Additional columns containing car-related features (e.g., mileage, engine size, horsepower).

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
How to Run
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that the dataset car_price_prediction.csv is placed in the same directory as the script.

Run the Code: Execute the Python script to perform the EDA.

bash
Copy
Edit
python car_price_prediction_eda.py
This will generate various plots such as:

The distribution of car prices.

Box plots of price distributions by features like year.

A correlation matrix to visualize relationships between different features.

Key Features of the Analysis
Missing Values Check: Identify columns with missing data and handle them appropriately.

Categorical Data Encoding: Convert categorical features (like car brands) into numerical values for analysis.

Statistical Summary: Get the summary statistics of the numerical features in the dataset.

Visualizations:

Price Distribution: Understand the distribution of car prices in the dataset.

Price vs Year: Visualize how car price changes with the manufacturing year using box plots.

Correlation Matrix: Analyze the correlation between numerical features and car prices.

Results
Based on the analysis, you will be able to gain insights such as:

The relationship between car features and price.

The distribution and trends in car prices over different years.

Features that have a significant impact on predicting car prices.
